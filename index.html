            <h2>Docker Software</h2>
            <p>Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization, 
            also known as "containerization". It was first released in 2013 and is developed 
            by Docker, Inc. Docker is used to run software packages called "containers". Containers 
            are isolated from each other and bundle their own application, tools, libraries and 
            configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. 
            All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and are thus more lightweight 
            than virtual machines. Containers are created from "images" that specify their precise 
            contents. Images are often created by combining and modifying standard images downloaded 
            from public repositories.</p>
            <h3>History and Technology</h3>
            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>Solomon Hykes started Docker in France as an internal project within dotCloud, a 
            platform-as-a-service company, with initial contributions by other dotCloud engineers
            including Andrea Luzzardi and Francois-Xavier Bourlet. Jeff Lindsay also became involved
            as an independent collaborator. Docker represents an evolution of dotCloud's
            proprietary technology, which is itself built on earlier open-source projects such as Cloudlets.
            The software debuted to the public in Santa Clara at PyCon in 2013. Docker was released as open
            source in March 2013. On March 13, 2014, with the release of version 0.9, Docker dropped LXC as
            the default execution environment and replaced it with its own libcontainer library written in
            the Go programming language.</p>
            <h4>Technology</h4>
            <p>Docker is developed primarily for Linux, where it uses the resource isolation features of the
            Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces, and a union-capable file system such as OverlayFS
            and others to allow independent "containers" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the 
            overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines (VMs). The Linux kernel's support for 
            namespaces mostly isolates an application's view of the operating environment, including process 
            trees, network, user IDs and mounted file systems, while the kernel's cgroups provide resource limiting 
            for memory and CPU. Since version 0.9, Docker includes the libcontainer library as its own way to 
            directly use virtualization facilities provided by the Linux kernel, in addition to using abstracted 
            virtualization interfaces via libvirt, LXC and systemd-nspawn.
            Building on top of facilities provided by the Linux kernel (primarily cgroups and namespaces), a Docker 
            container, unlike a virtual machine, does not require or include a separate operating system.
            Instead, it relies on the kernel's functionality and uses resource isolation for CPU and memory,
            and separate namespaces to isolate the application's view of the operating system. Docker accesses the 
            Linux kernel's virtualization features either directly using the libcontainer library, which is available
            as of Docker 0.9, or indirectly via libvirt, LXC (Linux Containers) or systemd-nspawn.</p>
